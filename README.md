# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Code Quality with Biome

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code quality, formatting, and linting. Biome is a fast, modern alternative to ESLint + Prettier that provides:

- **Unified tooling**: Combines linting, formatting, and import organization
- **Performance**: 10-100x faster than ESLint + Prettier
- **Zero configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **TypeScript support**: Excellent support for TypeScript and React Native
- **Modern standards**: Built with Rust for optimal performance

### Biome Commands

```bash
# Check code quality (linting + formatting)
yarn check

# Fix auto-fixable issues
yarn check:fix

# Fix all issues (including unsafe fixes)
yarn check:fix:unsafe

# Format code only
yarn format

# Check formatting without changing files
yarn format:check

# Lint only
yarn lint

# Fix linting issues
yarn lint:fix
```

### Why Biome over ESLint + Prettier?

1. **Speed**: Biome processes files much faster than traditional tools
2. **Unified**: Single tool instead of managing multiple configurations
3. **Modern**: Built for modern JavaScript/TypeScript projects
4. **React Native optimized**: Excellent support for React Native patterns
5. **Zero config**: Works immediately without complex setup

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    yarn start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
yarn reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
